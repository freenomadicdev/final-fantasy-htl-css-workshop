<H style="background:grey;"> <strong>Welcome to my first HTML code </strong></h>
<P style="font:times new roman;"> This is going to be my first code with this language, i know that it seems like i am too late but you are never too late for knowledge,<em>
i do think it is easy</em> however i am not going to lie, it will be hard for me to concentrate, i tend to underestimate things, although i
usually remember what i understand, but i know that<strong> my mind is looking for something more interesting and stimulating than writing a code
 although it is really Easy.</strong></p>
<h2 style="color:purple;"> who am i?</h2>
<p2 > My name is Abdullahi A. i am 26 years old and i'm  very excited and anxious about learning HTML, see i always had a thing for Technology, i was so profecient in 
phones when i was young, i am talking about NOKIA type of phonenot the mini Computer touch screen kind of phones, but i never considered going to
school and learning deeper, see i learned windows on my own and that was the only computer that i used to use or still now do, and i never had
the need to learn anything else about the computers other than the things that i encounter on a daily basis, few years ago with the exponential
growth of technology, i realized that i need to get deeper into the tech industry and start learning HTML.</p2>.
